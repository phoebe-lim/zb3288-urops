Undergraduate Research Opportunities Project in Science done in conjunction with the Mechanobiology Institute at the National University of Singapore. This project was titled "Computational analysis of cancer spheroid invading the mesothelium" and spanned one academic semester.

The project abstract is as follows:\
During ovarian cancer metastasis, cancer spheroids have been found to invade and clear the mesothelial layer. Though tissue-level models of spheroid invasion of the mesothelium have been proposed, the pattern of cell dynamics in spheroids during invasion has been relatively unexplored. Using tracked motion data of cells in invading and non-invading spheroids, temporal autocorrelation and spatial correlation analyses were carried out to quantify the pattern of cell migration. This study provides a theoretical basis for single cell-directed migration in invading spheroids, as well as collective cell migration in non-invading spheroids. Regional differences in the duration of directed cell migration show that the bottom of spheroids undergo invasive spreading. Results also suggest that either scattered cell migration or a combination of collective cell migration and neighbour exchange occur in invading spheroids.
